# Payload OAuth Plugin (Unofficial)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Providers

There is long list of providers that I want add into this plugin. But with every provider there is some implementation differences that has to be taken under consideration to keep the workflow streamlined and more generalised for all providers. Hence I will be aiming for most widely used providers for now. Check out the list:

- [X] Google
- [X] GitHub
- [ ] Auth0
- [ ] Azure Active Directory
- [ ] Discord
- [ ] Dropbox
- [ ] Facebook
- [ ] Instagram
- [ ] GitLab
- [ ] Okta
- [ ] Slack
- [ ] Reddit
- [ ] X(Twitter)
- [ ] Netlify
- [ ] Salesforce
- [ ] LinkedIn
