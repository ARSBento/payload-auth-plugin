## Open Authorization/OpenID Connect Protocol Based Providers
This plugin includes multiple pre-configured Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID Connect protocol-based providers. These configurations streamline the developer experience and integrations, ensuring the authentication process is seamless and uniform across different providers.

To get started, you'll need the Client ID and Client Secret tokens, which can be found in the provider's console/dashboard. Simply provide these tokens to the plugin's provider settings.

Some providers may require additional domain-specific metadata that cannot be generalized. In such cases, you'll need to provide these specific details as well.
